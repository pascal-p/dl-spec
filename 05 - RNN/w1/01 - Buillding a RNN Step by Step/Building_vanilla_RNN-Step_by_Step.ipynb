    "# Building your vanilla RNN - Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Course 5's first assignment! In this assignment, you will implement key components of a Recurrent Neural Network in numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory\". They can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some information/context through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time-step to the next. This allows a unidirectional RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirectional RNN can take context from both the past and the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation**:\n",
    "- Superscript $[l]$ denotes an object associated with the $l^{th}$ layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Superscript $(i)$ denotes an object associated with the $i^{th}$ example. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Superscript $\\langle t \\rangle$ denotes an object at the $t^{th}$ time-step. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Sub**script $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "- $a^{(2)[3]<4>}_5$ denotes the activation of the 2nd training example (2), 3rd layer [3], 4th time step <4>, and 5th entry in the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-requisites\n",
    "* We assume that you are already familiar with `numpy`.  \n",
    "* To refresh your knowledge of numpy, you can review course 1 of this specialization \"Neural Networks and Deep Learning\".  \n",
    "    * Specifically, review the week 2 assignment [\"Python Basics with numpy (optional)\"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/item/Zh0CU).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Input with $n_x$ number of units\n",
    "- For a single timestep of a single input example, $x^{(i) \\langle t \\rangle }$ is a **1-dimensional** input vector.\n",
    "- Using language as an example, a language with a 5000 word vocabulary could be one-hot encoded into a vector that has 5000 units.  So $x^{(i)\\langle t \\rangle}$ would have the shape (5000,).  \n",
    "- We will use the notation $n_x$ to denote the number of units in a single timestep of a single training example.\n",
    "\n",

    "- A recurrent neural network has multiple time steps, which we will index with $t$.\n",
    "- In the lessons, we saw a single training example $x^{(i)}$ consists of multiple time steps $T_x$.  \n",
    "  For example, if there are 10 time steps, $T_{x} = 10$\n",

    "#### 3. Batches of size $m$\n",
    "- Let's say we have mini-batches, each with 20 training examples.  \n",

    "- For example, this tensor has the shape (5000, 20, 10). \n",

    "- The 3-dimensional tensor $x$ of shape $(n_x, m, T_x)$ represents the input $x$ that is fed into the RNN.\n",

    "#### 5. Taking a 2D slice for each time step: $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$\n",
    "- At each time step, we will use a mini-batch of training examples (not just a single example).\n",
    "- So, for each time step $t$, we will use a 2D slice of shape $(n_x, m)$.\n",

    "- We will refer to this 2D slice as $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$. \n",
